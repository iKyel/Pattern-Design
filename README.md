# Design Patterns Project

This project demonstrates 10 fundamental design patterns implemented in code. Each pattern is represented by a sample implementation that includes a description, code, and example usage. These patterns are categorized into **Creational**, **Structural**, and **Behavioral** types.

## Overview

Design patterns are reusable solutions to common problems in software design. They help developers write code that is more flexible, maintainable, and scalable. This project includes a collection of classic design patterns often used in object-oriented programming.

## Design Patterns Included

### Creational Patterns

- **Prototype**: Create new objects by copying an existing object, known as the prototype.

### Structural Patterns

- **Proxy**: Provide a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control access to it.

### Behavioral Patterns

- **State**: Allow an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes.
- **Template**: Define the skeleton of an algorithm in a method, deferring some steps to subclasses.
- **Memento**: Capture and restore an object's internal state without violating encapsulation.
- **Strategy**: Define a family of algorithms, encapsulate each one, and make them interchangeable.
- **Mediator**: Define an object that encapsulates how a set of objects interact.
- **Observer**: Establish a one-to-many dependency so that when one object changes state, its dependents are notified.
- **Chain of Responsibility**: Pass a request along a chain of handlers until one of them handles the request.
- **Command**: Encapsulate a request as an object, allowing parameterization of clients with queues, requests, and operations.
